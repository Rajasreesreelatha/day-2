        <p>Category  Natural / Scenic beauty
            Three hills, each rising to 4,000 ft and above, together form this huge hill. Each of these hills have a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom owing to which it gets its name Kuda Kallu (umbrella shaped rock). The medicinal herb Neela Koduveli, which bathes the hillsides in blue, grows here. This flower is also believed to possess supernatural powers which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest. The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunchback rock). Across this rock is a 1/2 feet wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell). From the hilltops, the Arabian Sea can be seen in the distant horizon as a thin blue line. The sunset on a full moon day is sensational, when the moon can be seen rising up like another sun, as the orange sun goes down.<br>

                <h1>2.ILAVEEZHAPOONCHIRA</h1>
                <p>Ilaveezha poonchira, a hill station near Melukavu Mattom, 60kms from Kottayam is gaining tourist importance.
                    Located among three beautiful hillocks Mankunnu, Kudayathoormala and Thonippara, Poonchira is a place of picturesque charm. Legends say that the pool here was a bathing place for Panchali the legendary heroine of Mahabharata. The D.T.P.C. is developing this place into a trekking spot. A tourist bungalow with rooms and dormitory to accommodate 15 people has been constructed. The beautiful valleys of Poonchira are spread across thousands of acres. The verdant landscape punctuated by the gigantic hills, each rising to around 3200 ft. is an ideal place to unwind. During the monsoons when the valley fills up to form a scenic lake, this place unveils yet another beautiful slice of nature. Ilaveezha poonchira means valley where leaves donâ€™t fall and is named so because the place has no trees. This is also one of the best places in Kerala to witness both the sun rise and sunset.
