    <p><b>Venice of the East</b> <br>
        One of the cleanest and the oldest planned towns in India, Alleppey is a picturesque coastal delight, with backwaters, lagoons, canals, beaches festooning the city like nothing else. No wonder why Alleppey was nicknamed 'Venice of the East', ironically by the most notorious Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon.
        
        Besides this, Alleppey is extremely famous for its snake boat races, which occur in the monsoon season. Alleppey's backwaters are the most popular destination in Kerala. Other places of interest in Alleppey are Alleppey Beach, which offers a breathtaking view of Laccadive Sea, Krishnapuram Palace, St. Andrew's Basilica, and Haripada Sri Subrahmanya Swamy Temple.</p>
    <p><b>Paddy Cultivation in Backwaters</b> <br>
        The backwaters of Alleppey is home to Kuttanad, often called The Rice Bowl of Kerala. Traversing through a houseboat in this region offers a beautiful green kaleidoscope of rich paddy fields, interspersed with coconut trees. The paddy is cultivated on huge areas of reclaimed land from the Vembanad lake.
        
        The reclamation took place over three phases, starting from 1865 to 1940. These reclaimed areas are called Padsekharam. Initially, the reclaiming was done manually with water wheels, and later with steam engines. The paddy fields are drained by 4 major rivers - Pampa, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala. Speculations have claimed that it is the only area in the world where farming is done up to 2 metres below sea level.</p>
